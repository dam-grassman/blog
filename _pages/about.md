Hi, my name is Damien GRASSET. I'm a french and freshly-graduated engineer working in the field of AI and currently based in Montreal. I've always been interested in mathematics and computer sciences on the one (academic) hand, as well as in video games and robots on the other (informal) hand. Reinforcement Learning appeared to me a few years ago as a perfect field at the junction of what I like (and what I was good at, academically at least). I don't consider myself a geek, even though I spend a non negligeable part of my days in front of a screen (be it at work or at home), I'm also a huge fan of football (soccer for canadians, even if they're wrong) which I practiced and still practicing a lot. Last but not least, I'm also a music lover, playing guitar and piano in my spare time.

#### Paris...
<small> - 2018</small>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Born and raised. I've always thought I was going to spend my entire life there but travelling abroad quite change my mind on this. Paris remains the most beautiful city i've visited so far (in all objectivity), but it is certainly not the place where one can have the healthiest lifestyle. I still think I will end up settling here one day though.
</p>

#### London...
<small>2018</small>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I lived in London for 6 months, working as a machine learning engineer at Therapy Box. I fell in love with this city for a bunch of different reasons that I'm won't list here, it would be too long. One thing I recommend though it to experience living in a country where the language is different from your mother tongue. It is something you can really learn and grow from.
</p>

#### Montreal...
<small>2020 - </small>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I arrived in Montreal two weeks before the pandemic hit Canada. Unsurprisingly, my experience in Canada was not what I had imagined when I applied for a work visa two years ago. However, I consider myself quite lucky : first of all to have been able to travel and settle there just before the borders closed, and secondly Montreal turned out to be a really pleasant city to spend this difficult time. I'm still waiting for my social life to start for good though ..

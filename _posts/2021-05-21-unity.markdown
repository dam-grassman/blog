Unity is a beautiful tool to make video games. As part of my interest in reinforcement learning, some spare time I had this year appears to be the perfect opportunity for me to dive into it and get my hands dirty. 

I wanted to make something easy, with the most basic tools and packages available for free in Unity. As I've been working remotly for almost a year and a half now (basically since I joined Montréal), I got inspired by my former workplace (even if lots of details and dimensions are definitely not accurate).

The project was to design a game, similar to "Where's Waldo" ("Où est Charlie?" in french). A character is randomly placed on the map, and one needs to find him (and literally run into it). Everytime you succeed, Waldo is placed somewhere else, and so on.

The graphic of the game looks a little bit chidldish, but I did what I could using the basic toolkit available (made of cubes, spheres and cylinders). I can't say I'd play this game for hours though ...

Here's what it looks like :

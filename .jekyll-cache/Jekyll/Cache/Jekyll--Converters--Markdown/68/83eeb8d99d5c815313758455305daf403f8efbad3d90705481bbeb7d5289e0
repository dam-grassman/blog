<p style="text-align:right;">-- <strong>Judea Pearl</strong> in ”The Book Of Why”</p>

<p>Judea Pearl introduced the concept of <i>Ladder of Causation</i>, as a conceptual and abstract way to sort the different level at which us, as human, reason, in order to introduce notions of causality :</p>
<ol>
  <li> <i>Association</i> - the first level consists in <i>seeing</i>, or <i>observing</i>, which cover most of the robot and animal's basic learning. It enables to answer questions like "What if I see ?", "How are the variables related" or "How would seeing X change my belief in Y"? It corresponds to the estimation of <math>p(Y|X)</math> </li>
  <li> <i>Intervention</i></li>
  <li> <i>Counterfactual</i></li>

<p style="text-align:right;">-- <strong>Judea Pearl</strong> in ‚ÄùThe Book Of Why‚Äù</p>

<p>Judea Pearl introduced the concept of <i>Ladder of Causation</i>, as a conceptual and abstract way to sort the different level at which us, as human, reason, in order to introduce notions of causality :</p>
<ol>
  <li> <i>Association</i> - the first level consists in <i>seeing</i>, or <i>observing</i>, which cover most of the robot and animal's  learning. It enables to answer questions like "What if I see ..?", "How are the variables related" or "How would seeing X change my belief in Y"? It corresponds to the estimation of <math>p(Y|X)</math> </li>
  <li> <i>Intervention</i> - the next level enables you to act within your environment and witness the results of your own actions. It allows you to answer question like "What if I do ..?", "How can I make .. happen?" or "What would Y become if I do X"?. It is really crucial to grasp the difference between the first and second ladder because here is introduced the notion of causality between what I see and what I do. We aim at estimating <math>p(Y|do(X))</math>. 
  
  So as to fill the gap between those two levels, Pearls introduced the framework of <i>do-calculus</i>, which relates both observational and interventional distribution </li>
  <li> <i>Counterfactual</i></li>

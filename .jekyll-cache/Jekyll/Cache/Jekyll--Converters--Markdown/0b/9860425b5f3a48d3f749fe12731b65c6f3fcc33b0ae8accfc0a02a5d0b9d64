I"Å<p>Unity is a beautiful tool to make video games. As part of my interest in reinforcement learning, some spare time I had this year appears to be the perfect opportunity for me to dive into it and get my hands dirty.</p>

<p>I wanted to make something easy, with the most basic tools available for free in Unity. As Iâ€™ve been working remotly for almost a year and a half now (basically since I joined MontrÃ©al), I got inspired by one of my former workplace (even if it is not entirely accurate on lots of details and dimensions).</p>

<p>It is supposed to be a game, similar to â€œWhereâ€™s Waldoâ€ (â€œOÃ¹ est Charlie?â€ in french). A character is randomly placed on the map, and youâ€™ll need to find him (and literally stand next to him). Everytime you succeed, he is placed somewhere else, and so on.</p>

<p>The graphic of the game looks a little bit chidldish, but I did what I could from the basic toolkit available made of cubes, spheres and cylinders. I canâ€™t say Iâ€™d play this game for hours though â€¦</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s what it looks like :</p>

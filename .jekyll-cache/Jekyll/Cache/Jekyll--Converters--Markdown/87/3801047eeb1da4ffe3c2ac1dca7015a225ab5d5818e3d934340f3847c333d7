    â€œStatistics focused exclusively on how to summarize data, not on how to interpret it [...]. Data can tell you that people who took a medicine recovered faster than those who did not, but they canâ€™t tell you why.â€œ

    â€œData are profoundly dumb [...]. Thatâ€™s all a deep-learning program can do : fit a
    function to data.â€œ
